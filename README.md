# Electron Trigger Protector

A easy-to use open-source resource to protect your FiveM server's events.

## How it works

When you create a new trigger with, RegisterNetEventSecured, the name of the trigger will be randomized/abscoured.
When triggering it with TriggerServerEventSecured, there will also be a randomized number attached, this makes it more difficult to execute triggers from menu's.
